# BikeSharing Analysis

# Overview of the Statistical Analysis

## Purpose:
  In this module we had the opportunity to learn and utilze Tableau for visualization.  We did so by analyzing Citi Bikd data for NYC. The analyis of the bike sharing program
  in NYC was analyzed to show the feasibility of similar program for Des Moines.  
  
## Results:
The results showed, my opinion, that this is a very feasible business plan with some parameters. Toursim doesn't appear to be the primary driver of utilzation. It is actually the subscribers (which are local customers). This is important, because since De Moines doesn't have the same amount of tourism as NYC. This shows that this type of bikesharing program may be well received in a city like De Moines. Additionally, men were definitely the primary utilizers so marketing efforts should be directed at men.  Lastly the middle of the week (Wed and Thurs) were the high utlization days, which could reflect that utilization could be driven by "bike commuters" and not simply for leisure/entertainment on the weekends. This would suggest that the bike locations and drop off may be better in areas where there is high business concentration. This link below is a summary/visualization of results:

## Summary
The results show that this program is worth persuing. This initial analysis demonstrate that there is a local appeal to the bikesharing program.  To finalize the decision I would want to see further analysis on the city of De Moines. Firstly, what is the presence of businesses in De Moines. Is their a concentration of business and foot traffic during the weak that can help sustain this program. I would also want the know the gender and age demographics of the city since this program appears to be geared toward younger men.
